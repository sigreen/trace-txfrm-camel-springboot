# Fuse Integration Services (FIS) Trace Transformer Endpoint

This example demonstrates how you can use a Trace Transformer endpoint in Apache Camel with Spring Boot.

The quickstart uses Spring Boot to configure a little application that includes a Camel route that sets a static body, transforms it using a sample map in Trace Transformer, and logs the resulting Camel body.

### Running the example standalone with SpringBoot

The example can be demonstrated by running the following command:

    mvn spring-boot:run

### Running the example in OpenShift

It is assumed that:
- OpenShift platform is already running, if not you can find details how to [Install OpenShift at your site](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/install_config/index.html).
- Your system is configured for Fabric8 Maven Workflow, if not you can find a [Get Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-middleware-for-openshift/3/single/red-hat-jboss-fuse-integration-services-20-for-openshift/)

The example can be built and run on OpenShift using a single goal:

    mvn -P ocp

When the example runs in OpenShift, you can use the OpenShift client tool to inspect the status

To list all the running pods:

    oc get pods

Then find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    oc logs <name of pod>

You can also use the openshift [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/getting_started/developers_console.html#developers-console-video) to manage the
running pods, and view logs and much more.
